# AIGraph4pg Tutorial : Solution Architecture and Implementation

---

##### Implementation Language: Python

This reference implementation was developed with the **Python**
programming language, but Python isn't required for your implementation.
There are PostgreSQL driver libraries in multiple programming languages
such as **Java, C#, Node.js/TypeScript, Ruby, Go, R**, and others.
Your solution can be built with your choice of a programming language
that supports PostgreSQL.
The complete list of [PostgreSQL drivers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/List_of_drivers)
is listed here.This Python implementation makes use of the following primary libraries, which are available
at the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/).

* [psycopg](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg/)
  PostgreSQL driver supporting both Synchronous and Asynchronous calls
* [fastapi](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/)
  Modern Asynchronous Web Framework
* [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
  Provides convenient access to the Azure OpenAI REST API
* [ageqrp](https://pypi.org/project/ageqrp/)
  Small library used to parse the results of Apache AGE queries with psycopg
* [hypercorn](https://pypi.org/project/Hypercorn/)
  Web server which runs your fastapi python module

So as to focus on the PostgreSQL and Apache AGE aspects of the solution,
the codebase intentionally doesn't use an Object-Relational Manager (ORM) such as
[SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/).
You are free, of course, to use any programming language and set of libraries
for your implementation.

##### Graph Visualization: D3.js

This reference implementation uses the free and open-source
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) JavaScript library.
With D3.js you can create beautiful and interactive visualizations
of your Apache AGE graph data.Other open-source and proprietary graph visualization libraries are available.
[Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) is one of
the best alternatives to D3.js.

##### Development Environment

This solution was developed with the following recommended development tools:

* [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  VSC is a lightweight yet extensible and full featured text editor and
  Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
  It is produced by Microsoft and free of charge.
  It is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
* [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
  AI-assisted code completion tool that works with VSC.
* [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)
  A terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL.
  You can execute psql from within Windows PowerShell or Linux/macOS terminal
  to interact with your Azure PostgreSQL database.
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  are recommended tools for creating and testing container-based applications.
  The use of these tools, however, is not further discussed in this tutorial
  as they aren't necessary to execute the solution from your development computer.
  See the Deployment Environment section, below, that lists two execellent Azure PaaS
  services where your Docker containers can be deployed to.

##### Deployment Environment

The following **Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) services** are required
for this solution:

* [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/overview)
  Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a fully managed database service that provides
  Enterprise functionality over open-source PostgreSQL.
  The PostgreSQL open ecosystem supports **extensions** to the database;
  this is one of the compelling features of PostgreSQL. For example, the
  **postgis** extension supports GPS and spatial applications while**pg\_cron** supports job schedling similar to linux.This reference implementation uses the following extensions:
  + [age](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/extensions/concepts-extensions-versions#age)
    Apache AGE project for graph database functionality with openCypher.
  + [vector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/extensions/concepts-extensions-versions#vector)
    Standard vector search functionality (but not DiskANN vector search)
  + [azure\_ai](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/extensions/concepts-extensions-versions#azure_ai)
    Provides Azure AI and ML Services integration for PostgreSQL.See the [complete list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/extensions/concepts-extensions-versions)
  of supported extensions for Azure Database for PostgreSQL.This reference implementation uses one relational table, named **legal\_cases**,
  which has the following structure as shown in the following psql output.
  Note that there is a **jsonb** column as well as a
  **vector(1536)** for the embeddings generated by the Azure OpenAI
  text-embedding-ada-002 model described later on this page.
  ```
  
  dev=> \d legal_cases
  Table "public.legal_cases"
  Column              |          Type           | Collation | Nullable |                 Default
  --------------------+-------------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------------------------------
    id                | bigint                  |           | not null | nextval('legal_cases_id_seq'::regclass)
    name              | character varying(1024) |           |          |
    name_abbreviation | character varying(1024) |           |          |
    case_url          | character varying(1024) |           |          |
    decision_date     | date                    |           |          |
    court_name        | character varying(1024) |           |          |
    citation_count    | integer                 |           |          |
    text_data         | text                    |           |          |
    json_data         | jsonb                   |           |          |
    embedding         | vector(1536)            |           |          |
  Indexes:
    "legal_cases_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
    "idx_legal_cases_citation_count" btree (citation_count)
    "idx_legal_cases_court_name" btree (court_name)
    "idx_legal_cases_decision_date" btree (decision_date)
    "idx_legal_cases_ivfflat_embedding" ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists='50')
    "idx_legal_cases_json_data_gin" gin (json_data)
    "idx_legal_cases_name_abbreviation" btree (name_abbreviation)
        
  ```
  This reference implementation also uses one **Apache AGE graph**,
  which is also named **legal\_cases**. This name does not have to
  correspond to the above relational table name, as they are two distinct objects
  in PostgreSQL. They are populated separately.The graph is described in the Graph Queries page of this application.
* [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/)
  PaaS service to access and invoke, via a Python library, the Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  models implemented by OpenAI.
  Witnin your Azure OpenAI service, these two model deployments are required:
  + [text-embedding-ada-002](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#embeddings)
    Used for generating **embeddings** from text input.
    In the case of this model the embedding values contain 1,536 dimensions,
    meaning that each embedding is an array of 1,536 floating point numbers
    which capture the semantic meaning of the given text.
    The embeddings are used in **vector search** to search the
    database for rows with similar semantic meaning to the given vector or embedding.
  + [gpt-4o](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#gpt-4)
    This model is used in this reference application for **Generative AI**
    to generate openCypher queries from natural language.
    This GenAI functionality is currently under development in this repo.
* [Azure Machine Learning (AML)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/machine-learning)
  Enterprise-grade AI PaaS service for the end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle
  including model deployments.
  AML is not yet used by this reference implementation, as
  [semantic ranking](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/introducing-the-semantic-ranking-solution-for-azure-database-for-postgresql/4298781)
  of vector search results is not yet implemented in this repo.
* Either Azure Container Apps (ACA)
  or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  are recommended for hosting your deployed **web application**
  Docker containers in Azure.You will use a [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/)
  to store your Docker images for deployment to ACA or AKS.
  Likewise, in an Azure deployment, you should use an [Azure Key Vault (AKV)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/)
  to store your secrets and connection strings.**Deployment of the web application, however, is out-of-scope for this reference implementation**
  as the web app is intended to run from your development computer.
  Thus, ACA, AKS, ACR, and AKV are not used in this reference implementation.
